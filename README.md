### Key Components

1. **Decentralized Data Management**: Our smart contracts enable users to securely register and share data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it.

2. **Compensation System**: LED-UP incorporates a unique compensation model that ensures data providers receive fair payment for their contributions, incentivizing data sharing.

3. **Serverless APIs**: Built using Azure Functions, our APIs provide scalable and efficient means of interacting with the LED-UP platform, facilitating data uploads, sharing, and retrieval operations.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: We offer extensive documentation to guide developers in effectively utilizing our platform, covering everything from smart contract integration to API usage.

<!-- 5. **Adaptability Across Sectors**: The LED-UP framework is designed to be versatile, improving digital interactions in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, education, and humanitarian efforts. Our focus includes sensitive contexts, such as aiding displaced individuals in refugee camps by providing secure access to essential services.

6. **Seamless Integration**: LED-UP is engineered to integrate effortlessly with existing software ecosystems, enhancing them with advanced privacy and security features without disrupting current operations. This compatibility allows organizations to adopt LED-UP technologies without significant overhauls, facilitating a smoother transition toward more secure and privacy-conscious digital practices. -->
